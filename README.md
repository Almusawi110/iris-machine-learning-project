# Iris Species Classification

This repository focuses on analyzing the famous Iris dataset and building a machine learning model to classify the species of Iris flowers. The dataset is widely used in data science for exploring classification algorithms, visualizing data, and testing various machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers from three species:
- **Iris setosa**
- **Iris virginica**
- **Iris versicolor**

Each sample includes measurements of:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

In this project, we use these features to create a **linear discriminant model** to classify the flower species. The analysis demonstrates data preprocessing, visualization, and model building techniques.

## Repository Contents

- **Notebook**: `iris_linear_discriminant_model.ipynb`
  - Step-by-step analysis and classification using the Iris dataset.
  - Includes data visualization and model evaluation.
- **Dataset**: The Iris dataset is loaded directly from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris).

## Requirements

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Almusawi110/iris-machine-learning-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd iris-species-classification
   ```
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook iris_data_visualization_classification.ipynb
   ```

## Results

The project demonstrates how to:
- Visualize the Iris dataset features and relationships.
- Preprocess the data for machine learning.
- Build and evaluate a linear discriminant analysis model.
